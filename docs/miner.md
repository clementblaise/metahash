# MetaHash Miner Guide (Subnet 73)

## üéØ Should you be a miner?

Pls before start mining in sn73 ask you the following question:
Do i want to sell OTC alpha of other subnets?
I am willing to give a discount for it in exchange on not impacting the subnet pools. 

If yes, lets proceed

## üéØ How it works?

**You're competing with other miners in auctions that happen each epoch where 148 sn73 alpha are auctioned and you get it proportional to how much tao value of alpha you sent**

- Bid against other miners every ~1 hour to win the bag (148 sn73 alpha)
- Win proportional rewards based on your bid value
- 148 SN73 tokens available per auction

**What other miners do affect you as the bag is always 148 alpha but the total value provided depends on miner. So final discount is undertermined and depend on competition**

## ‚ö° Quick Start

**Step 1:** Decide which subnet alpha you want to sell OTC  
<br>**Step 2:** Register on Subnet 73 a miner (one time only)  
<br>**Step 3:** Make sure in the same COLDEY of you miner you have that alpha ready.
**Step 4:** Once the auction start send alpha manually or use our scripts to help you

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/fx-integral/metahash/ && cd metahash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install uv && uv pip install -e .

# Register (ONE TIME ONLY)
btcli s register --netuid 73 --wallet.name YOUR_WALLET --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Mining Tools

### Tool 1: Check Competition
See who's winning and track performance:

```bash
python scripts/miner/leaderboard.py \
    --meta-netuid 73 \
    --wallet.name YOUR_WALLET \
    --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY
```

### Tool 2: Auto-Bid (Recommended)
Automatically compete in auctions:

```bash
python scripts/miner/auction_watch.py \
    --netuid SOURCE_SUBNET_ID \
    --validator-hotkey VALIDATOR_HOTKEY_ADDRESS \
    --wallet.name YOUR_WALLET \
    --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY \
    --max-alpha MAX_ALPHA_PER_AUCTION \
    --step-alpha BIDDING_INCREMENT \
    --max-discount MINIMUM_DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD
```

**What it does:**
- Watches for new auctions
- Bids your alpha in small steps
- Stops if discount gets too low
- Prevents over-bidding


## üìä How Auctions Work

### The Competition
- **Who:** All miners registered on SN73
- **When:** Every 361 blocks (~1 hour)
- **Prize:** 148 SN73 alpha tokens
- **How to win:** Send highest value alpha tokens
- weights are given proportionally to total post slippage tao value sent by each miner coldkey to treasury

### Example Auction
```
Total auction value: 100 alpha tokens
Your bid: 20 alpha tokens  
Your share: 20% √ó 148 = 29.6 SN73 tokens
```


## ‚úÖ Rules & Restrictions

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED
- Send alpha from any subnet except 73
- Bid on multiple auctions
- Use automated scripts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è FORBIDDEN
- Cannot send SN73 alpha to auctions
- Only ONE registration per coldkey

### üéØ GOAL
- Maximize value of alpha sent
- Beat other miners in auctions

## üí° Winning Strategies

### Be Fast
- **Bid early** for better discounts
- **Use automation** to beat manual traders
- **Monitor constantly** for new auctions

### Be Smart
- **Set minimum discounts** (don't accept bad deals)
- **Watch competition levels** before bidding
- **Use surplus alpha only** (don't hurt your main subnet)

### Be Safe
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Stop if over-subscribed** (you get nothing if auction is too full)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Track your performance** (learn what works)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Start small** (test before going big)

## üî• Common Scenarios

### üü¢ Good Auction (Low Competition)
- Few miners bidding
- You get good discount
- High returns

### üü° Busy Auction (High Competition)  
- Many miners bidding
- Lower discount
- Still profitable if you're strategic

### üî¥ Bad Auction (Over-Subscribed)
- Too many miners bidding
- Late bidders destroy the discount for everyone
- Everyone gets worse deals

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Mine other subnets first** to get alpha tokens
2. **Register on SN73** (remember: only once per coldkey)
3. **Start with small bids** to learn the market
4. **Use the leaderboard** to study competition
5. **Scale up** as you get more confident

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Alpha tokens from other subnets
- Configured btcli wallet
- Basic understanding of auctions

**üí° Pro Tip:** Start by running the leaderboard script to watch a few auctions before jumping in. Learn the patterns, then start bidding small amounts to get experience!
